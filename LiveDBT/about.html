                        LiveDBT is an application I developed to benefit Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) users on a daily
                        basis. While other DBT aplications are focused more on mobile-users, LiveDBT is designed to be used
                        on any web-capable device, and is intended only as a method of practicing the skills as frequently as
                        is needed. The main feature is the card system, going over each of the 5 key pillars of DBT per subject.
                        Other features include lists, checklists, note-taking, reminders, progress overview (user profile), and
                        more.

                    <p>
                        Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that began with efforts
                        to treat Borderline Personality Disorder (also known as Emotional Instability Disorder). DBT
                        has been proven useful in treating mood disorders, suicidal ideation, and for change in
                        behavioral patterns such as self-harm, and substance abuse. DBT evolved into process in which
                        the therapist and client work with acceptance and change-oriented strategies, and ultimately
                        balance and synthesize them, in a manner comparable to the philosophical dialectical process of
                        hypothesis and antithesis, followed by synthesis.

                    <p>
                        Marsha M. Linehan (born May 5, 1943) is an American psychologist and author. She is the creator
                        of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a type of psychotherapy that combines behavioral science
                        with Buddhist concepts like acceptance and mindfulness.

                        Linehan is a Professor of Psychology, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at
                        the University of Washington in Seattle and Director of the Behavioral Research and Therapy
                        Clinics. Her primary research is in borderline personality disorder, the application of
                        behavioral models to suicidal behaviors, and drug abuse.

                    <h1>What is BPD?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Borderline personality disorder (BPD), also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder
                        (EUPD), is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterised by unstable relationships
                        with other people, unstable sense of self and unstable emotions. There is often dangerous
                        behavior and self-harm. People may also struggle with a feeling of emptiness and a fear of
                        abandonment. Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events. The behavior typically
                        begins by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations. Substance abuse,
                        depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD. Up to 10% of people
                        affected die by suicide.

                    <h1>What is the ladybug for? (Footer <image src="css/images/ladybug.svg" width="50px" height="auto"/>)</h1>
                    <p>
                        May is BPD Awareness Month, and to show support friends, family and others are invited to wear ladybug pins.
                        This practice was started by the National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder (NEABPD) as
                        a way to show support for loved ones suffering from the struggles of BPD.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea for LiveDBT came from my girlfriend, who happens to suffer from BPD herself. Although she has never
                        gotten to experience group therapy, she does have a lot of experience with self-help and practicing the
                        skills taught in DBT. If it weren't for her help during the research of this project, I would have had to 
                        spend a lot more time trying to understand therapy methods, history, and smaller details that can be important.
                        So as a way of showing my support for her struggle with BPD, and appreciation for her help, LiveDBT maintains
                        the ladybug icon year-round, since the project was created during the month of May.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before the idea for LiveDBT came around, I previously was helping my girlfriend with a project called
                        "Panic Pal". It was designed as a panic attack assistant application to help people cope when they don't
                        have access to any tools or easy methods of calming down. Panic Pal is a much larger project with many
                        more features than LiveDBT, but one of the key parts is DBT and the skill practice. Since I was 
                        so pivotal to the conception of Panic Pal, my girlfriend suggested I create the main component as my
                        Portfolio 4 project, and then she could later utilize the information that I typed up, and use what I
                        learned to build a more streamlined version into Panic Pal.
